┌ Warning: Interrupted. Larger maxiters is needed. If you are using an integrator for non-stiff ODEs or an automatic switching algorithm (the default), you may want to consider using a method for stiff equations. See the solver pages for more details (e.g. https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/ode_solve/#Stiff-Problems).
